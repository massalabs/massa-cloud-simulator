Python bindings to the Ed25519 public-key signature system.

This offers a comfortable python interface to a C implementation of the
Ed25519 public-key signature system (http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/), using the
portable 'ref' code from the 'SUPERCOP' benchmarking suite.

This system provides high (128-bit) security, short (32-byte) keys, short
(64-byte) signatures, and fast (2-6ms) operation. Please see the README for
more details.

## Not Recommended For New Applications: Use pynacl Instead

For new applications, I recommend you use
[`pynacl`](https://github.com/pyca/pynacl) instead of this repository.
`PyNaCl` is larger and takes longer to build (it contains the complete
NaCl/libsodium library, not just the ed25519 portion), but it is
well-maintained by the diligent and conscientious PyCA team, whereas I've
allowed this repository to languish. `PyNaCl` is also about 10-20 times
faster. A guide for migration fron `python-ed25519` to `PyNaCl` is included
below.
